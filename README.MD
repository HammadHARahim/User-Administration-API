# User Management System

## Overview

The User Management System is a Node.js application designed to provide robust user management functionalities, including user registration, authentication, role-based access control, and profile management. This system serves as a foundational tool for web applications, making it easy to integrate and extend as your project grows.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Secure user sign-up with input validation.
- **Authentication**: Password hashing and user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign roles to users and manage permissions based on roles.
- **Profile Management**: Update user profile details such as username, email, and password.
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation and sanitization of user input.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for better debugging and user experience.
